            <p> "As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me:this is exactly the place 
            I've been looking for all my life. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. 
            I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists. 
            I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."
